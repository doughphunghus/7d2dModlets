# REPO HAS BEEN MOVED!
No longer committing code to this fork, instead made new repos for ease of use in the 7D2D Mod Launcher
This repo is staying here as you can see the fork from Khelldon's original mod page, and is used to refirect you to the latest repo version you are looking for.

# For 7D2D version a17: 
See Original Khelldons modlets this repo is forked from here [7d2dModlets](https://github.com/Khelldon/7d2dModlets)

**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

### 7d2dModlets
Forked from Khelldons original alpha17 "7 Days to Die" modlets to work with later game versions.
Note: Should anyone, The Fun Pimps, etc wonder, Khelldon gave permission to use/update these as needed, per https://7daystodie.com personal communications. I plan on trying to keep these up to date and close to original purpose/functionality as much as I reasonably can.
