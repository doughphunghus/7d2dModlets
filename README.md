**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

### 7d2dModlets
Forked from Khelldons original alpha17 "7 Days to Die" modlets to work with later game versions.
Note: Should anyone, The Fun Pimps, etc wonder, Khelldon gave permission to use/update these as needed, per https://7daystodie.com personal communications. I plan on trying to keep these up to date as much as I reasonably can. 

**To install game mods**: [7 Days to Die modlet installation](https://gist.github.com/doughphunghus/a1907c5f63b5fe79bd823965328f25bf)
