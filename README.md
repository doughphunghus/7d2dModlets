### 7d2dModlets
Khelldons original alpha17 "7 Days to Die" modlets.
Note: Should anyone, The Fun Pimps, etc wonder, Khelldon gave permission to use/update these as needed, per https://7daystodie.com personal communications. I plan on trying to keep these up to date as much as I reasonably can.

#### Doughphunghus's fork - General updates:
Mods were originally written for a17, updated them for a18, mostly by:
- Adding/migrating Localization.txt
- Adding/modifying Readme.md to indicate a18 support
- Modifying ModInfo.xml to change version number to  differentiate it from originals.
  - Bumped version to 2.0.0 when mod is no longer compatible with a17
  - Added "-doughphunghus" to version number to indicate the modlet comes from this fork
- Migrating existing icons
- Adding display values for item statistics
- Updating xpath when needed

#### Notes:
- 2020-01-14: Theres a lot of mods here so testing them in a18 has not been completed yet.
- Not all mods had Localization info or may have missing icons.  Please submit an issue if you find one.
- Mods that modify the "UI" were not converted so they may not work. Please submit an issue if you find one.
