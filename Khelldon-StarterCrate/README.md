# Starter Crate
This modlet gives the player a crate of random gear to start the game with.

Doughphunghus's fork - updates:

- Mod originally written for a17, likely works with a18
- NOTE: The Lootcontainers are based on ID (ugh) and not names so its likely
this will ahve to be incremented every time a new version comes out AND likely
to conflict with anyone adding mods that add other loot containers.
Not sure (probably likely) coudl choose a random lootcontainer ID BUT its all
an issue using ID's anyway
